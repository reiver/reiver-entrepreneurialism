§ Pitch Deck

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

A **pitch-deck** is a presentation tool used to pitch a [[start-up-venture]], a product, a service, or anything else (that is being pitched).

It is often either a series of slides, or an essay, or some combination.

Typically, the person pitching is going to [[tell-a-story]] (or stories), but show the **pitch-deck** while they are telling that story.

The **pitch-deck** can help guide the story being told, and also gives the audience something interesting to look at while the pitch has happened.

**Pitch-Decks** are common with [[entrepreneurialism]].

§§ Structure

And the exact structure of a **pitch-deck** should help tell the story.

But this is one way one //could// structure a **pitch-deck**:

• purpose
• problem
• solution
• why now
• market potential
• alternatives
• business model
• team
• vision
